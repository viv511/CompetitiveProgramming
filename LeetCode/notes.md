## LeetCode Notes
- Blind 75
- NeetCode 150 --> neetcode.io
- High Frequency Company List

## General Notes
Focus on not just solving problems, but also understanding the underlying concepts and patterns.
You need to write code that is going to be effective and well written, not just code that works.

> **Principle of Essential Complexity:** Good code shouldn't have explicit edge case checks, it should be able to handle them implicitly.

## ROI Problems
- Focus on high ROI problems ==> Stick to Pareto Principle

## PBOI Approach
- Pen and Paper (Understand the problem)
- Brute Force (Naive Approach)
- Optimize (know T & S Complexity)
- Implement (When you actually code it)

**THINK BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING**

Honestly speaking, I'll be using this repository for all of my competitive programming / DSA learning. I'll be updating this repository with all the problems I solve, and the concepts I learn. I'll also be updating my notes here, so that I can refer to them whenever I want.
