//Imagine each node is a ball and each edge is a string.
//Simply "lift" the desired start node and all of the nodes will neatly fall into place in the desired height orders.
//This is a BFS traversal ==> visit a vertex, and then all of its neighbors, and then all of their neighbors, and so on.

//This is useful to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
//Order does not matter in a BFS traversal, so there are multiple correct answers.
